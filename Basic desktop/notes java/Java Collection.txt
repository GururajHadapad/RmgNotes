Array Disadvantages                             Advantages of Collection over Array
1.Array is Homogenius.                          1.Collection is hetrogenius.
2.Array is Fixed in size.                       2.Collection doesn't have fixed size.
3.Array doesn't have inbuilt functions.         3.Collection has inbuilt functions.


      List                                                    Set                                           Map
List is an interface.                            Set is an interface                            Map is an interface
1.It is Hetrogenius.                             1.Set is Homogenius.                           1.Map stores data in key& value pairs
2.It will accept duplicate.                      2.It will not accept Duplicate values          2.It will not accept duplicates keys, 
3.It will accept N number of null values.                                                          it will accept duplicate values
4.It maintains insertion order.                                                                 3.In Map Keys are Homogenius but values
                                                                                                   but values are hetrogenius.
ArrayList                                         HashSet                                          
1.ArrayList is class.                            1.Hashset doesn't maintain insertion order.       
2.Data Structure is Growable/Resizeable          2.Data structure is HashTable.
3.It is used for Delete operation.               3.It will accept 1 null value.
4.Contains 3 overloded constructurs.             4.HashSet has 2 constructors.
5.Default capacity of AL is 10(DC*3/2).          5.Default capacity of HS is 16(DC*2/0.75)
                                                        
LinkedList                                          LinkedHashSet   
1.LinkedList is a class.                         1.LinkedHashSet is a class.
2.Their is no default capacity.                  2.Data Structure Doubly linkedLidt.
3.LinkedList is used addition/                   3.It is maintaining insertion order.
    /manipulation of elements.                   4.It has 5 Construtors.

                                                     TreeSet
                                                 1.TreeSet is a class
                                                 2.Data structure of TreeSet is Balanced tree.
                                                 3.It will not accept Null value
                                                 4.It will print in sorted order.
